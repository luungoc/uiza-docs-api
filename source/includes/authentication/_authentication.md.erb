The Uiza API uses [API Key]() to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API Keys in the [Uiza Dashboard](/application-setting/publish-api).

*Your API keys contain rights and permissions to your account; therefore, make sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.*

<!-- 

In order, to use the Uiza, you should follow these steps:

**Step 1**: Having an active Uiza account. (If you don't have, please get [here](https://id.uiza.io))

**Step 2**: Once you have an Uiza account, you can get a Token to call the APIs.

This Token will have right & permission related with your account. -->
