The Uiza API uses [API Key]() to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API Keys in the [Uiza Dashboard](/application-setting/publish-api).

*Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.*

Authentication to the API is performed via [HTTP Basic Auth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). Provide your API key as the basic auth username value. You do not need to provide a password.

If you need to authenticate via bearer auth (e.g., for a cross-origin request), use -H "Authorization: Bearer uap-5126204af4ee487f9c295525f03b9268-353340ef" instead of -u uap-5126204af4ee487f9c295525f03b9268-353340ef.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.
