Uiza calls videos as `Entities`. You can create entities by uploading media files using [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol), [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol), and [S3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3) links. The Video APIs provide CRUD operations (create, retrieve, update, delete) on the entities. You can retrieve individual entities as well as a list of all of your entities.

All entities need to be [published](#publish-entity-to-cdn) before the public can access. Unpublished videos can still be [edited](#update-an-entity), [listed](#list-entities) by `APIs` or using [Dashboard](https://dashboard.uiza.io/) but the [Player](#Player) cannot not play.
