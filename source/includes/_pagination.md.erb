# Pagination

All top-level API resources support bulk fetches via "list" API methods. For instance, you can [list entities](#list-entities), [list categories](#list-categories), and [list invoices](#list-recorded-files). These list API methods share a common structure, taking at least these two parameters: `limit`, `page`.

***LIST RESPONSE FORMAT***

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **data** | *string* | An array containing the actual response elements, paginated by any request parameters. |
| **metadata** | *string* | Contains `total` as total number of `data` without pagination, `result` as number of paginated `data`, `page` as current page, `limit` as how many records each array of `data` contain. |
