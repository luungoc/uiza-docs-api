# Live Streaming

Live streaming is managed by Uiza's `Live Event`. A live event allows you to **pull** contents from other sources such as [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) or any [HLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) link. You can also broadcast a live stream with a **push** type of live event.

A live event can be recorded. These records are save as [entities](#video).

To start a live stream you must [create a live event](#create-a-live-event) first.

```IMPORTANT: Live minutes start counting as soon as the live event starts. ```
