# Live Streaming

Live streaming is managed by Uiza's Live Event. A live event allows you to **pull** contents from other sources such as Youtube or any HLS links. You can also broadcast a live stream yourself with a **push** type of live event.

A live event can be recorded. These records are save as [entities](#video).

To start a live stream you must [create a live event](#create-a-live-event) first.

```IMPORTANT: Live minutes start being counted as soon as the live event starts. ```
